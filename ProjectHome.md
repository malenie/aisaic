## Summary ##

Accurate identification of significant aberrations in cancers (AISAIC) is a systematic effort to discover potential cancer-driving genes such as oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Two major confounding factors against this goal are the normal cell contamination and random background aberrations in tumor samples. We describe a Java AISAIC package that provides comprehensive analytic functions and graphic user interface for integrating two statistically-principled in silico approaches to address the aforementioned challenges in DNA copy number analyses. In addition, the package provides a command-line interface and a pro-grammable interface for users with scripting and programming needs to incorporate or extend AISAIC to their customized analysis pipelines. This open source multiplatform software offers several attractive features: (1) it implements a user friendly complete pipeline from processing raw data to reporting analytic results; (2) it detects deletion types directly from copy number signals using a Bayes hypothesis test; (3) it estimates the fraction of normal contamination for each sample; (4) it produces unbiased null distribution of random background alterations by iterative aberration-exclusive permutations; and (5) it identifies significant consensus regions and the percentage of homozygous/hemizygous deletions across multiple samples. AISAIC also provides users with a parallel computing option to utilize ubiquitous multi-core machines.
